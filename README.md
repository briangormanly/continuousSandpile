# Discrete Sandpile Experiment
## Research in modeling Power Laws

### Overview
The 5-discrete-critical/ folder contains the working sandpile of interest, the other folders are all pre-experiments mostly in learning rust and playing with appropriate datastructures and ui techniques. None of the other folders demonstrate criticality or power law outcomes, but instead build the model to the critical state but exhibit no invariance of scale as future additions of grains simply roll off the pile. The model in 5-discrete-critical/ does exhibit these properties and will be the only model discessed.
